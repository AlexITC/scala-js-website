## Problem

You want to get started quickly with Scala.js, if possible from some existing pre-configured project.

## Solution

One good way is to clone the example application provided by SÃ©bastien Doeraene.

The project is located here:

[https://github.com/sjrd/scala-js-example-app](https://github.com/sjrd/scala-js-example-app)

This application has the following already set-up for you:

* SBT settings for Scala.js
* HTML pages for development and production
* Jasmine testing
* Main and test classes
* Sample code
