Scala.js compiles Scala code to JavaScript, allowing you to write your
Web application entirely in Scala!

Outstanding features are:

*   Support all of Scala (including macros!),
    modulo [a few semantic differences](http://www.scala-js.org/doc/semantics.html)
*   Very good [interoperability with JavaScript code](http://www.scala-js.org/doc/js-interoperability.html).
    For example, use jQuery and HTML5 from your Scala.js code, either in a
    typed or untyped way. Or create Scala.js objects and call their methods
    from JavaScript.
*   Integrated with [sbt](http://www.scala-sbt.org/)
    (including support for dependency management and incremental compilation)
*   Can be used with your favorite IDE for Scala
*   Generates [Source Maps](http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/developertools/sourcemaps/)
    for a smooth debugging experience (step through your Scala code from within
    your browser supporting source maps)
*   Integrates [Google Closure Compiler](https://developers.google.com/closure/compiler/)
    for producing minimal code for production.

## Get started

The easiest way to get started is to fork the
[bootstrapping skeleton](https://github.com/sjrd/scala-js-example-app)
and follow the instructions in its readme.
