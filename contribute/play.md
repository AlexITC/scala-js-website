title: Integration with Play
---
{% include JB/setup %}

[Play](http://www.playframework.com/) has built-in support for aggregating and
serving JavaScript, and even for compiling CoffeeScript source files.
It might be interesting to investigate how we can make integrate Scala.js
source files in the mix.

[Lift](http://liftweb.net/) is another Web framework for Scala. I am not
familiar enough with it to know whether Scala.js has anything to offer to it.
