Scala.js is a fairly young project. Currently, it has a working core compiler,
and a minimal sbt plugin. But there is a lot more to do, and you can help!

This page is a non-exhaustive list of things that you can do to contribute to
Scala.js, pushing it to a production-ready state.

You can fork [the repo on GitHub](https://github.com/lampepfl/scala-js) to get
started. If you start seriously on something, make sure to
[mention it on the mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/scala-js)
to avoid duplicating efforts.

If you think about something else, come and discuss on the mailing list too!
