Scala.js is a fairly young project. Currently, it has a working core compiler,
and a minimal sbt plugin. But there is a lot more to do, and you can help!

*   Improve this website and the documentation by
    [forking it on GitHub](https://github.com/scala-js/scala-js-website)
*   [Port the Java library](javalib.html):
    expand the port of the Java library written in Scala.js
*   Check out the [ideas](https://github.com/scala-js/scala-js/issues?labels=ideas&page=1&state=open) on
    the issue tracker for other cool things you could work on,
    like [Play! Integration](https://github.com/scala-js/scala-js/issues/188) or a
    [Testing Suite](https://github.com/scala-js/scala-js/issues/96)

If you start seriously on something, make sure to
[mention it on the mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/scala-js)
to avoid duplicating efforts.

If you think about something else, come and discuss on the mailing list too!
