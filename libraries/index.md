Great libraries make programming so much easier. With Scala.js you can use both Scala and JavaScript libraries in your code easily.

### [JavaScript facades](facades.html)
Interact with JavaScript libraries in a safe, strongly-typed manner.

### [Scala libraries](libs.html)
Libraries traditionally running on the JVM, now running on JS as well!

### [Testing](testing.html)
Make sure your code starts correct and stays correct.

### [Project Skeletons](skeletons.html)
Get started quickly.

### Add a Scala.js badge on your library site

Show your true colors by adding a Scala.js badge on your site! Select the lowest Scala.js version your library is compatible with.

If you don't find your version of Scala.js, that's probably because it is forward-compatible with its predecessor,
in which case you should take the latest available version older than your version of Scala.js.
For example, for Scala.js 1.9.x, use the 1.8.0+ badge.
