After a couple months of design, content writing, and a lot of discussions, we
are pleased to finally release our new website for Scala.js! Most if not all of
the credit for this huge task goes to [Otto Chrons](https://github.com/ochrons).
Big round of thanks to him!

[Go and see the front page!]({{ BASE_PATH }}/)

This new website is structured and designed specifically for front-end
developers, highlighting the benefits of Scala.js over JavaScript itself, but
also ECMAScript 6 or other languages targeting JavaScript, such as TypeScript.

We hope you will like it. Come and tell us in
[the Scala.js Gitter chat room](https://gitter.im/scala-js/scala-js)!
We would love to hear your feedback.
